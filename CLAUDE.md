## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"

### 4. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: implement the elegant solution instead
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer

### 5. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user

## Core Principles
- Simplicity First: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- No Laziness: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.
- Minimal Impact: Only touch what's necessary. No side effects with new bugs.
